# Warming up to Order Some Good Stuff
So you understand Katya's functions, and have a bit more knowledge of the sharemarket than you might have expected. Now it's time to start thinking about functions that will be useful in completing `makeOrders`!

Now your heuristic is up to you, and should certainl be your own creation. However, there are many functions which could be **very** useful for a variety of heuristics. 

## Brainstorming Useful Functions
For each of the following, don't just write the function- also brainstorm with your peers **where** this function might be useful, and **what** kind of heuristic it would be used for.

## Write & brainstorm... (single list functions)
1. a function that returns the average of a list
2. a function that finds the largest element of a list
3. a function that finds the smallest element of a list
4. a function that finds the difference between the largest and smallest values of a list

## Write & brainstorm... (lists of lists)
1. For a list of `StockHistory`, return the `Stock` with the largest average stock price (you might need something to help find the maximum average while using the tuple data type here!)
2. For a list of `StockHistory`, return the `Stock` with the smallest difference between the largest and smallest values of a list


Once you feel comfortable with these functions and understand how they could be used, try and code up a heuristic!
Then, it's time for you to go to the NEXT LEVEL. You better head to our advanced heuristics room for that!
