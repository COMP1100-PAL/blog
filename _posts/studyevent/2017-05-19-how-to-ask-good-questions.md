# HOW TO:
# *Ask Good Questions, According to Last Generation's Memes*

 !["HOT DAMN"](https://github.com/COMP1100-PAL/comp1100-pal.github.io/blob/master/img/advice-dog-code-not-working-explain-what-youve-done-and-whats-going-wrong-to-a-pal-mentor.jpg?raw=true "PARTAY")

### DO
* Figure out exactly what your problem/difficulty is - 
    * Are you not sure how to approach a particular function? 
    * Are you getting errors that you don't understand?
    * Is your function just not working as expected?

* Explain what you've done so far
    * How does your code work?
    * Are there parts of your code that you find difficult to explain? Please mention this, as you should be able to explain all of your code :)

### DON'T
* Say "I've got a _ error" and expect someone to fix it for you- show that you've thought about the error and what might be causing it
* Ask someone if your code "is right". Chances are, they may have done it differently, or can't see what you're doing right away. Explain your ideas and approach!
