# Higher-order functions
Jay and Tina want to become more environmentally sustainable. They has employed the use of higher-order functions to help them become green warriors of the Earth. They wants to go as far as to put the local garbage collector out of a job (or at least send him a message).

![TINA DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51bkvYYv5oL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg "Tina now has access")

## Type signatures warm up
These 7 R's will help Jay and Tina towards their quest to reduce their carbon footprints, but first they need to know what they mean.

What do the following type signatures mean? Debate in your groups.

```haskell

refuse :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]

reduce :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b

reuse :: (a -> a) -> a -> [a]

repair :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]

regift :: (a -> b) -> a -> b  

recycle :: (b -> Maybe (a, b)) -> b -> [a]

recover :: (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> (a -> c)

```
 
## What in Tony's name was mapList?
`mapList` is a higher order function that takes a function as input, and a list as input, and returns a new list where each element of the list has that function applied to it.

```haskell
mapList :: (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
mapList _ Empty = Empty
mapList f (Entry c cs) = Entry (f c) (mapList f cs)
```
* Have a go at defining `map` not with a split definition, but with pattern matching and using the inbuilt Haskell list.

## More interesting higher-order functions
Jay and Tina only need to contribute small steps towards their goal, can you help them? They are having trouble how to __implement__ some of these _vital_ steps.

`refuse` is a function that takes a predicate and a list and returns a new list where only elements that satisfy the predicate are included in that list.

* Have a go at writing the `refuse` function. The type signature was given above.
* Why is it useful? What could be a better name for `refuse`?

If you are having trouble thinking what a predicate could be, think about the difference between the types of `>` and `> 3` 

`repair` is a function that takes a function and two lists, uses the function to combine the elements of the lists up to the length of the shortest list.

* Have a go at writing the `repair` function. The type signature was given above.
* Why is it useful? What could be a better name for `repair`?

`recover` is a function that takes two functions and combines them into a single function.

* Have a go at writing the `recover` function. Type signature was given as usual.
* Why is it useful? What could be a better name for `recover`?

`reduce` is a function that takes an operator, an accumulator and a list, and returns the value that the list elements were accumulated on depending on the operator.

* Have a go at writing the `reduce` function. Type signature was given as usual.
* Why is it useful? What could be a better name for `reduce`?
