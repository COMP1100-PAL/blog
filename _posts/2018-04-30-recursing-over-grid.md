# Assignment Help: Recursing through 2D lists

To help with the assignment, you have a simple task today. You have a 2d array of Booleans (that looks like this as a data type: [[Boolean]] ). You're to write a function that takes this and returns a new 2d array where every entry is inverted, such that every True is now False, and every False is now True.
