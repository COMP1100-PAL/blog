Part B of the assignment has lots of confusing data types! _State_, _Graphics_, _InteractionOf_. Don't worry! By the end of this activity, you will be a master of Part B in no time!

## Understanding State
Consider the _State_ data type:

```haskell
data State = World
                [Graphic]
                Tool
                ColourName
```

1. What is the type name of the type constructor in State. What does it do?
2. Give an explanation of each of the component data types. Give an example of each.

We are going to understanding this data type through drawing. Go through the following exercise as a group:
a) Draw a "canvas" on the whiteboard. This is where we will draw pictures.
b) Consider this example of the _State_ data type:  ```World [Graphic (Line (1.0,1.0) (2.0,2.0)) Cyan (0.0,0.0)] (LineTool Nothing) Cyan```
Draw this _State_ on your canvas. Label each of the component parts.
c) Draw any shape you want on your canvas. Write out a corresponding _State_ data type.
d) Write a function called `extractGraphics`, which inputs a _State_ and outputs the `[Graphics]` of this _State_.
