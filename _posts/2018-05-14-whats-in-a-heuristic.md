# PRAY GAEM

# Try it out

Have a go at applying your heuristic to this sample board state. Play as Red (Grey in this picture) and move to the bottom right.

1. Convert this board to the data type in the assignment
2. Generate all valid moves for the given dice rolls
3. Apply your heuristic to each move and pick the highest one.
