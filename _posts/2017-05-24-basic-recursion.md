# Powerlist Powerplay
These exercises are going to see how you fair with basic recursive functions over lists.

1. Write a function that finds the length of a list

2. Write a function that sums up a list of numbers

3. Write a function that adds `4` to every element of `[2, 3, 4, 5]`

4. Write a function that finds the average of a list of numbers (Hint: this function isn't in itself recursive, but uses ones that are)

5. Write a function that returns an infinite list of type `a`

6. Write a function that returns every 2nd element in a list

7. Write a function that gets the element at the i'th index

8. Write a function that returns the last element of a list

9. Write a function that returns n many elements from the end of a list (Hint: use the length function)

```haskell

```
