# Hi

Paste Plane stuff here

# Extension: Further recursion questions
Write a recursive function which:
1. Multiplies two numbers, **without using the multiplies * function**. e.g. `multiply (4,5) = 20`
2. Adds up all the numbers before it down to 0. e.g. `adder 5 = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 10`
3. Finds the number of digits in a positive Integer e.g. `digits 100 = 3`
4. Finds if a number is even or odd e.g. `5 = "odd"`, `6 = "even"`
5. Decides if a number is prime (formal definition: divisible by only 1 and itself)
