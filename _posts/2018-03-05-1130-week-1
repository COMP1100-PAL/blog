## Side Effects

One important aspect of Haskell is that it is a side-effect free language. But what does this mean?

### Definition

There are three main characteristics to side-effect free functions:

* Same output for given input
* Does not rely on variables (during computation)
* Does not write to memory
    
### Example

__Side effect-free world: "If it rains today, the ground will be wet"__
__Side effecting world: "It rains today, the ground is wet and ANU campus is closed"__

### Questions

Which of these is side effect free?

* I write 5 on a whiteboard -- SA
* I think of the sentence "Hello World"
* Edmund pays Tina $10
* I dance alone in my room
* Robin gets a girlfriend
* Edmund loses a pen

### Philosphy?

If a program changes state but no one is there to see it, is it side effecting?
Computer Science says yes.

## Lambda Calculus

λ-calculus is essentially very high level mathematics.

```
1. λx.x
2. (λx.y)x
3. λx.(λy.x)x
```
