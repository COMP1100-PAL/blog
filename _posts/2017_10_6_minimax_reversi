For the following worksheet, we'll be using the full-information game "Reversi". If you're not sure how this game works, make sure to ask a friend (...we're your friends too, right? :<).
### Investigating Lookaheads

The PAL mentors Lachie-chan and Tina-senpai were playing a mad hectic game of reversi, but got distracted by a new ConnectX assignment patch, and left the game unfinished! It's your task to play the game as Tina, and figure out what moves you should play to win!!

Here is the board so far:
BOARD PIC HERE PLOX
#### Part 1
Firstly, lookahead XXX moves deep, and return the move that Tina should play to have the best score.

#### Part 2
Now lookahed XXX moves deep. Has the result changed? Is it possible for the result to have stayed the same?
