# Binary To English

Remember the poem Tiggy-senpai delivered to the class years ago? It was posted on Piazza in binary form.

Binary isn't human readable, so if you wanted to relive the epic moment again, you'd have to translate it to English... 
why do that by hand when you have a computer?

Your task, should you choose to accept, is to write a function that will translate binary in English. 
(Hint: Split this up into multiple functions)

Think about how you would go about doing this, and ask for help when you get stuck. Discuss ideas with each other!
