# Eight Queens

This is a classical problem in computer science. The objective is to place eight queens on a chessboard so that no two queens are attacking each other; i.e., no two queens are in the same row, the same column, or on the same diagonal.

```haskell
type Row a = [a]
type Board a = [Row a]

data State = Queen | NotQueen

type Segment a = [a]

-- Assume that you have this function
-- This function gives you the two diagonals of a board [top left to bottom right, top right to bottom left]:
diags :: Board a -> [Segment a]
```

Implement the following functions with the eight queens problem in mind:

```haskell
-- A function that lists all possible 

```
