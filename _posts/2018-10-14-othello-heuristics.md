# Rules of Othello
 (taken from Wikipedia :P )
 Each of the disks' two sides corresponds to one player; they are referred to here as light and dark after the sides of Othello pieces, but any counters with distinctive faces are suitable. The game may for example be played with a chessboard and Scrabble pieces, with one player letters and the other backs.

The game begins with four disks placed in a square in the middle of the grid, two facing white side up, two pieces with the dark side up, with same-colored disks on a diagonal with each other. Convention has initial board position such that the disks with dark side up are to the north-east and south-west (from both players' perspectives), though this is only marginally meaningful to play (where opening memorization is an issue, some players may benefit from consistency on this). If the disks with dark side up are to the north-west and south-east, the board may be rotated by 90Â° clockwise or counterclockwise. The dark player moves first. 

# Some Tips to Find Good Strategies...
1) Try to figure out which positions are best. Are there any places on the board that, once a piece has been put there, can never change colour?

2) Is it best to try and get lots of pieces at the beginning? Why/why not?

3) Is it easy to spot a good move? Is it easier to spot a bad move?
