# Getting Classy with Typeclasses
Typeclasses are great. We use them in Haskell to support **overloading**, where a function has multiple meanings with different type signatures. Don't worry, Haskell always chooses a meaning at compile time, based on how the function is used.

The best way to understand typeclasses is to understand *how they relate to each other*. So, today we ask that you draw a diagram of how the following typeclasses are related:

- Enum
- Integral
- RealFrac
- RealFloat
- Floating
- Fractional
- Num
- Show
- Eq
- Ord
- Ix
- Real

If you get stuck, try to think of examples of the typeclasses- do these types appear to be sub/superclasses of other typeclasses?


# Binary To English

Remember the poem Tiggy-senpai delivered to the class years ago? It was posted on Piazza in binary form. 
The link for reference:

Binary isn't human readable, so if you wanted to relive the epic moment again, you'd have to translate it to English... 
why do that by hand when you have a computer?

Your task, should you choose to accept, is to write a function that will translate binary in English. 
(Hint: Split this up into multiple functions)

Think about how you would go about doing this, and ask for help when you get stuck. Discuss ideas with each other!
