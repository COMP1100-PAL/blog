## What is Recursion

At this point, we can do a lot with haskell. We can write quite complex types and functions with many inputs and interesting outputs. With guards and cases, our functions can also make decisions based on its inputs. However, we do have one significant limitation: how do we make haskell code that loops or repeats for a certain amount of time? This is where _**Recursion**_ comes in!

So what is the essence of recursion? At its core, it is two steps:

- _**Base Case**_: We have a terminal output that stops the loop.
- _**Recursive Case**_: We want to continue the loop and so call ourselves.

Together, these two steps make recursion and allow our haskell to perform loops.

At the moment, this seems rather technical, weird and strange. So let's look at an example:
```haskell
data [Int] = [] | Int : [Int]
```
This is a recursive ```data``` type and so let's dive into how it works. We are defining the ```data``` type:
```haskell
[Int]
```
The type is defined as one of two options (the options being split by ```|```):
```haskell
[]
```
or
```haskell
Int : [Int]
```
The first option is the _Base Case_: ```[]``` is an empty list and doesn't call upon anything else, terminating the output. The second option is the _Recursive Case_: the ```Int``` is some integer value (an element of the list) and then we concatenate it with the data type again ```[Int]```. So we can add an element to the list and then continue with the rest of the list of integers.

We can consider a specific instance of this ```data``` type. To do this, we will use a _**Trace**_ that outlines the computation or logic that Haskell will run on your computer:
```haskell
[1,2,3,4,5] = 1 : [2,3,4,5]
            = 1 : 2 : [3,4,5]
            = 1 : 2 : 3 : [4,5]
            = 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : [5]
            = 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 5 : []
```
At each step, the entire type is ```[Int]```, but the trace shows how the recursive type unfolds iteratively and then terminates with the case case.

Let's look at another example. This one will be a function:
```haskell
sum :: [Int] -> Int
sum list = case list of
    []  -> 0
    _   -> (head list) + sum (tail list)
```
where ```head``` gets the first element of the list and ```tail``` gets the rest of the list:
```haskell
head [1,2,3] = 1
tail [1,2,3] = [2,3]
```
So for ```sum``` the base case is
```haskell
[] -> 0
```
This is the final step and ends the function. The recursive step is
```haskell
_ -> (head list) + sum (tail list)
```
This step gets the first element of the list and adds it the sum of the rest of the list. Together, this lets us calculate the sum of a list:
```haskell
sum [1,2,3,4]   = 1 + sum [2,3,4]
                = 1 + 2 + sum [3,4]
                = 1 + 2 + 3 + sum [4]
                = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + sum []
                = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 0
                = 10
```
So we use the recursive step until we reach ```sum []```, at which point the case steps in and we return ```0``` and add the elements.

We quickly note that there many different syntactic ways to define recursive. Here are some alternative ways of defining the ```sum``` function:
```haskell
sum :: [Int] -> Int
sum list = case list of
    []  -> 0
    _   -> (head list) + sum (tail list)

sum :: [Int] -> Int
sum list
    | list == []    = 0
    | otherwise     = (head list) + sum (tail list)

sum :: [Int] -> Int
sum [] = 0
sum list = (head list) + sum (tail list)
```
The first is a case expression, the second is a guarded function and the third uses multiple independent definitions.


## Question 1: Identifying Recursion

In the last section, we outlined the two distinct parts that form recursion. Now in your groups, consider the following functions/types and answer these questions:

1) Does the function/type use recursion? If it does, what is the base case and what is the recursive case?

2) What does the function/type do?

Use examples and traces to see if a function is recursive.

```haskell
function1 :: [Int] -> Int
function1 ls
    | ls == []  = 0
    | otherwise = 1 + function1 (tail ls)
```

```haskell
function2 :: [Int] -> Int
function2 [] = 0
function2 list = 1
```

```haskell
function3 :: Int -> Int -> Int
function3 m n
    | m == n    = m + n
    | m > n     = m * m
    | otherwise = n * n
```

```haskell
function4 :: Int -> Int -> Int
function4 n x = case n of
    1 -> x
    _ -> x + function4 (n - 1) x
```

```haskell
function5 :: Int -> Bool
function5 i
    | i == 0    = True
    | i < 0     = False || function5 (i + 1)
    | otherwise = False || function5 (i - 1)
```

```haskell
data [Int -> Bool] = (Int -> Bool) : [Int -> Bool] | []
```

```haskell
data myCoolType = My | Type | Is | Cool
```

## Question 2: Filling in the Blanks 

Now that we have a deep knowledge of recursion, let's try write some recursion ourselves. We will begin by filling in the blanks. So try complete these functions:

```haskell
lastElement :: [Int] â€”> Int
lastElement ls = case ls of
    []  -> error "No Last Element"
    [x] -> _______________________
    _   -> lastElement ___________
```

```haskell
capitalise :: String -> String
capitalise ____ = ""
capitalise str  = (toUpper ____) : (____ (tail str))
```
Note: ```toUpper``` is a ```Prelude``` function that makes characters upper case. For example: ```'a' -> 'A'```.

```haskell
stringAddition :: String -> String -> String
stringAddition str1 str2
    | str1 == []    = ______
    | otherwise     = ______ (init str1) (last ______ : ______)
```
Note: ```init``` gets all but the last element of a list. For example: ```"abc" -> "ab"```. ```last``` is the proper Haskell verion of our ```lastElement```.


## Question 3: Writing Our Own Recursive Functions

Consider the factorial function from mathematics:

```
n! = n * (n-1) * ... * 2 * 1
```
So, for example, ```3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6```. Let's try to construct a factorial function in Haskell using recursion!

``` haskell
factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial i ...
```

## Question 4: Master of Recursion

Reversing a string seems like a pretty standard function:
```
"hello" -> "olleh"
```
So let's write it in Haskell:
```haskell
reverse :: String -> String
reverse str ...
```
But now let's consider the harder problem: reversing list of strings and reversing the strings inside a well:
```haskell
["A man", "a plan", "a canal", "panama!"] -> ["!amanap" ,"lanac a" ,"nalp a","nam A"]
```
This function is clearly more difficult, but give it a shot:
```haskell
reverseWithReverse :: [String] -> [String]
reverseWithReverse list ...
```
(Hint: use ```reverse```.)
