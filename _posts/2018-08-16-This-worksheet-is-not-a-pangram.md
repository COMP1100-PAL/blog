# This Worksheet Title is Not a Pangram 

Lists give us some powerful tools that let us deal with different representations of data. In this exercise you’ll have to think about different ways to represent whether or not we’ve reached our goal.

Let’s use lists and recursion to determine if a given string is a pangram. An anagram is a word or phrase with the same letters as another word or phrase (‘nag a ram’ is an anagram of ‘anagram’), whereas a pangram is a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet. The most popular of these is ‘The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy fox’. See how it uses at every letter of the english alphabet at least once?  

## Your task:
Use lists and recursion to determine whether a string is a pangram

```haskell
isPangram :: String -> Bool
isPangram sentence ->Your Soluiton Here<-
```
