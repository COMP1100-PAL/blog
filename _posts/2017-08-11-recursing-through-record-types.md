# Shine Bright like a Sharknado
### Prelude
*After your amazing performance in your first week at Buzzfeed, they've moved you into something resembling an office- well it's technically a bathroom, but at least there's working lighting.*

***"We have such an exciting new opportunity for you!"*** *your boss exclaims. She's flushing with enthusiasm, echoing the toilets behind your small desk. But your cynicism fades in the face of her excitement- you can't help but sit up straight- feeling tall- ready to finally make a meaningful contribution to the world through the art of programming.*

***"We're desiging a online minigame to accompany the release of Sharknado 5, and we need you to set up the data types and functions. It's such a fabulous opportunity! Oh, think of the children our work will inspire- we'll create a new generation of passionate weather forecasters, waiting for their glimpse of a real sharknado!"***

*Your mouth begins to open in retaliation, but it's too late. The boss disappears in a flash, leaving only a sticky note behind her... you almost fall off your stool in a rush to grab it, terrified it might make contact with the moist floor...*

# Extension: Further recursion questions
Write a recursive function which:
1. Multiplies two numbers, **without using the multiplies * function**. e.g. `multiply (4,5) = 20`
2. Adds up all the numbers before it down to 0. e.g. `adder 5 = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 10`
3. Finds the number of digits in a positive Integer e.g. `digits 100 = 3`
4. Finds if a number is even or odd e.g. `5 = "odd"`, `6 = "even"`
5. Decides if a number is prime (formal definition: divisible by only 1 and itself)
