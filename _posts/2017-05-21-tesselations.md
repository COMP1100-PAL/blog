*Note: This is a group activity - a Haskell-version Chinese Whispers. The first person will write the function (in Haskell), the next will write a DESCRIPTION (in English), etc. (Haskell, English, Haskell, ...). Don't worry about specifics - just use the data definition or syntax you are most familiar with, this is supposed to be fun*

**_Remember to use a generic function name so you don't give it away e.g. foo, bar_**

Pick one of the following functions (don't tell anyone your choice!) and begin the cycle by writing it in Haskell (don't worry if you don't finish it):

1. Finds the first element of a list
2. Puts the elements of a binary tree into a list
3. Counts the leaves of a binary tree

14. Takes a list and predicate, and returns the elements of the list where the predicate applies

20. A function that applies a function over all elements a list
