'Twas the week before exams,
and all through the night,
comp students were coding,
with laptop screens bright.
>
"My code doesn't work!",
one student exclaimed,
"My types are all jumbled,
and debuggings a pain!"
>
"My assignment's half finished,
I don't know recursion,
Is there anyone who can help,
not a tutor, a person?!"
>
"Someone who struggled,
 someone like me,
who has survived the course,
and is now free?"
>
He logged onto Piazza,
and his prayers came true,
"PAL mentoring every day,
Hancock West at 2!"
>
He attended next day,
and what did he find?
A place to learn code with friends,
with mentors kind.

Learn from this student,
come to PAL and you'll see,
your grades will increase,
From P's to HD's.


PAL mentoring provides a casual atmosphere for learning skills that will make you a whiz kid at computer science. Sessions for COMP1100 run daily at 

* Monday from 1PM in Hancock West 2.27
* Tuesday from 4PM in Hancock West 2.27
* Wednesday from 12PM in Hancock West 2.22
* Thursday from 2PM in Forestry level 1 room 103

PAL is where you will work in groups on activities relevant to course material, exams, and assignments.  PAL is not compulsory, but past statistics clearly show a strong correlation between grades and PAL attendance!
Hope to see you there.
