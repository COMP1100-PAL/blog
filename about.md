'Twas the week before exams,
and all through the night,
comp students were coding,
with laptop screens bright.
>
"My code doesn't work!",
one student exclaimed,
"My types are all jumbled,
and debuggings a pain!"
>
"My assignment's half finished,
I don't know recursion,
Is there anyone who can help,
not a tutor, a person?!"
>
"Someone who struggled,
 someone like me,
who has survived the course,
and is now free?"
>
He logged onto Piazza,
and his prayers came true,
"PAL mentoring every day,
Hancock West rooms!"
>
He attended next day,
and what did he find?
A place to learn code with friends,
with mentors kind.

Learn from this student,
come to PAL and you'll see,
your grades will increase,
From P's to HD's.

PAL is where you will work in groups on activities relevant to course material, exams, and assignments.  PAL is not compulsory, but past statistics clearly show a strong correlation between grades and PAL attendance!
Hope to see you there.
